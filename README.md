## 🌍 Why NGNC?

Billions of naira move across borders every year for trade, education, remittance, and investment. Yet, traditional systems remain slow, expensive, and fragmented.

NGNC solves this by:
- Simplifying remittance and international trade
- Giving Africans access to programmable money
- Bridging the gap between crypto and traditional banking
- Promoting pan-African financial independence

## 🚀 Vision

NGNC is part of a larger ecosystem (including the **Bridge App**) that aims to:
- Connect naira and digital currencies in a compliant way
- Serve African entrepreneurs, students, and traders globally
- Scale into a multi-chain, audited, and institution-ready stablecoin
